#Inspiration

As college students, our workload can become a lot. What if we explored a fun and kooky way to get our work done and enjoy it at the same time?

#What it does

Introducing FortuneKookie, the ultimate study assistance that brings a kooky twist to your learning experience!

With FortuneKookie, studying becomes an exciting journey. Our website combines the "wisdom" of fortune cookies as it prioritizes your mental health. It is FILLED with treasures of fortune, with a Pomodoro technique, we help you break your work into manageable intervals, with occasional Mood Checks to assess how you're feeling, and a mini de-stressor clicker game to help your mood!

#How we built it

For the Kooky Clicker Game. Pomodoro Timer and Mood Check, we used HTML, CSS and Java Script and used conditionals to build the game, we used a Quotable API and used motivational build a survey.

#Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge for us was the fact that all four members of our team were freshmen. Therefore, we were lacking of real-life programming experiences. However, we overcame the challenge by learning the programming languages while building the codes and communicating with teammates to help and teach each others.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of

We built the site, the game, the survey, and the timer from scratch!

#What we learned

Debugging, Working together, and Writing new types of programming languages codes

#What's next for FortuneKookie

More minigames on the way to keep you entertained Other study methods other than Panodoro. More personalised quotes to help you feel connected and get the best advices. New interactive UI on the way to improve interaction
